# Event Guest List Manager

A simple, dynamic, single-page web application for managing an event guest list. This project was built to practice working with forms, capturing user input, and updating the page dynamically using JavaScript â€” all without refreshing the browser.

## Detailed Description

This application provides a clean interface for managing event attendees without any page reloads. All operations are handled dynamically on the client-side.

**Key Features:**
* **Add Guests:** Add guests by name and category (Friend, Family, Colleague).
* **Dynamic List:** The guest list updates instantly as guests are added.
* **Remove Guests:** Easily remove guests from the list with a dedicated button.
* **Edit Names:** An "Edit" button allows for inline updating of a guest's name, which then becomes a "Save" button.
* **Toggle RSVP:** Mark guests as "Attending" or "Not Attending." The UI reflects this status with a strikethrough and color change.
* **Guest Limit:** The application enforces a maximum of 10 guests and alerts the user if they try to exceed the limit.
* **Timestamps:** Displays the time each guest was added to the list.
* **Same Guest NamesL** Displays Name and Category if guest already exists with same name(case-insensitive) and category as input.
